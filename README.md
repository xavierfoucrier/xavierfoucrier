## Hello :wave:

Welcome to my Github profile!

I am **Xavier**, a **Senior Creative Developer** from La Rochelle, based in France.  
Open source lover, Webpack bundler, Atom user. Mostly coding javascript and building libraries that embrace the web power.

I am part of the **[@barbajs](https://github.com/barbajs) core team**. Most time, I manage issues on the Github repository, make code contributions, update the documentation website and mainly help people on Slack by answering questions/issues.

Today, almost **30% of my work time** is dedicated to open source. If you need help in your **development workflow** (debug/refactor/learn) or just like my work and want to give me some recognition, consider becoming a sponsor to keep me moving forward on this way.

You can discover my **Github Sponsors** profile and learn a little bit more about me at

**Thanks for your support âœŒ**
